## Inspiration
As college students, we understand the difficulty with budgeting given the new amounts of finances to juggle. After hearing about Capital One's challenge to create a financial tracker, we knew that this would be perfect to develop with a target audience of our college peers.

## Purpose 
Piggy Bank offers its users a personalized budgeting tool where they can track their expenses after setting a weekly goal. This allows users to have a transparent view of their spending habits and hopefully work towards being more financially literate. The home page will have a visual depiction of where the user is with their goal and recent transactions. For incentives, if the user completes the daily and weekly goals, they'll receive a currency to customize their piggy (Hopefully, it'll provide some sort of outlet)! Be a hero in your own life and save your piggy bank!

## Tools Utilized
* Figma
* Android Studio
* Java
* XML
> We didn't use any APIs nor public frameworks

## How we built it
We built this by making a prototype on Figma with hand-drawn pictures following a basic banking format. We wanted to reimagine banking and financing to make it engaging for the upcoming young adults struggling with being financially responsible. Then we wanted to implement it with a language(Java) we're familiar with to create an app so we chose Android Studio as our IDE. 

## Challenges we ran into
We have never implemented an app and we only know Java so we had a hard time trying to implement an app with all of the components from the Figma prototype. We chose Android Studio but we really didn't know how to use multiple functions on the IDE. We spent the majority of our time watching YouTube tutorials and researching how to use basic functions. We overcame this by really grinding out looking up and trying to apply basic knowledge taught in 1302.  We also just accepted that it's not feasible to become an expert at developing an app in a couple of hours and just did the best we could. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to present a prototype of the implementation! It might not have full functionality but we learned a lot of Android Studio basics that could potentially transfer over to other app development skills. We are also proud of being a little more literate in Git and understanding how it works. 

## What's next for Piggybank
As we learn more, we want to continue implementing the app to bring the complete application to fruition with full functionality because as of right this is just a skeleton with LITTLE to no implementation.
